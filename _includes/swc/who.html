  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at vacation students and other researchers and staff at CSIRO's Energy Centre in Newcastle.
  <strong>
    You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools
    that will be presented at the workshop.
  </strong>
  The focus will be on the Unix Shell, a classic piece of software for powerfully combining other software programs into a custom workflow.
It's required knowledge for using "high-performance computing‚Äù supercomputers, but also for automating day-to-day tasks on your personal workstation.
 
This course will (hopefully) be the first of many, with later lessons covering Version Control, a programming language (such as Python, R or Julia) and Data Science tools.
